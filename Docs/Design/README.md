InnoCalendar

A Telegram Bot which provides schedule of Elective Courses Innopolis University.
Problem

Elective courses schedule is available now in Google Spread Sheet and the schedule changes quite often. It is hard to track changes manually. In the current situation it is required to open Google Spread Sheet every day in order to see updates - there is no notifications at all.
Summary

Addressing the above stated problem, we assume that it will be comfortable to have notifications about upcoming classes and changes in schedule. The system benefits for all masters who wants to do homework on time and be aware of schedule changes.
Prior research

For implementation we propose to use Telegram Bot. The user will be able to find and subscribe to desired elective courses, while the bot will send notifications about changes in the official Google Spreadsheet and provide information of upcoming classes.
